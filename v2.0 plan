1) create classes for each type that only have properties and constuctors
		maybe also ToString()

2) create translators that CRUD the static data set and return the result transformed into the local type

3) cause the BL to use the translators before sending the info onto the UI
	in the same step, the UI has to be updated to relate to the new objects

4) Move the CRUD style methods from the BL into the DAL

5) Move the calculations from the UI into the BL
